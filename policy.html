    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 16th December 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect personal data in connection with our web application ("Web App"). The Web App is hosted on GitHub Pages (front-end) and communicates with a back-end Google Apps Script project. The Web App is an automation tool for managing datasets within a private group of individuals ("Group"). By using the Web App, you consent to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>The Web App is operated by an individual based in the Czech Republic ("we," "us," or "our"). Although located in the Czech Republic, this Web App serves users internationally, including users from the European Union (EU) and the United States.</p>
    <p>For privacy-related inquiries, please contact:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> pathos.sd@gmail.com</li>
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> "PRIVACY CONCERN" (please use this exact subject line without the quotations, or your inquiry may be ignored).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect the following personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Collected when you sign in via Google API to access the Web App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect sensitive personal data (e.g., financial, health, biometric information).</p>
    <p>Additionally, we maintain a manual list of authorized users (including email addresses) for purposes of managing access to the Web App. This list originates from individuals voluntarily providing their email to designees of the Group and is used to verify user access. While this list is separate from the Web App's functionality, the Web App may reference it to validate authorized users.</p>
    <p>Please remember that this policy covers only data collected through the Web App, not all data collected or used by the Group.</p>

    <h2>4. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We use your email address for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> To verify your identity and confirm that you are authorized to access and use the Web App.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Temporarily storing your email to enable actions without requiring repeated logins.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The manual list of authorized users may also <strong>be shared with other individuals within the Group</strong> to facilitate coordination and communication among members.</p>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Data Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We process your personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong>: Allowing users to interact with the Web App as part of its core functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> Your email address is temporarily stored in the back-end Google Apps Script project's cache. This data is automatically deleted no later than 6 hours after your session ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The Web App uses local storage/cache to store:
            <ul>
                <li>Your email address (for session continuity).</li>
                <li>An authorization token to validate requests to the back-end.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not store any personal data within the Web App permanently.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or disclose your personal data to third parties outside the group of individuals. However:</p>

    </ul>
